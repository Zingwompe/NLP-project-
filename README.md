Hello ! 

You are on the github page of Anna Nguyen Than Son and Gabrie Guaqui√®re NLP Project for ENSAE 2023.

In this project, we implemented a BERT model and a ROBERTA model to do Dialog Act and Emotion Sentiment classification.

Here is how we named our jupyter notebooks : MODEL_DATASET_type_of_classification.ipynb 

For instance :

-BERT_mrda_DA is the code we used to run our BERT model on MRDA data to do Dialog act classification
-ROBERTA_meld_e_ES is the code we used to run our ROBERTA model on meld_e data to Emotion/sentiment classification


NB : we ran our Bert model after having dowloaded the BERT uncased L12 H768 A12 in local, here is a link where you can download it : https://github.com/google-research/bert

If you want to run it using our code, make sure you download bert_model.ckpt, vocab.txt and bert_config.json using https://github.com/google-research/bert

Enjoy our project !
